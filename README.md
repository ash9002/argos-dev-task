# argos-dev-task
Argos graduate developer task - Ashley Muswere.

This web application fetches and displays Argos product data from the http://www.hotukdeals.com API for the top 10 'hottest' products. The Argos product prices are compared with prices for products on **ebay.co.uk** using the eBay API in a similar way. Basic product data and URLs to the HUKD, Argos and Ebay products are displayed in a tabular format.

##How To Run

Please contact me on **ashmuswere@gmail.com** if there's any issues running the web application.

### OS X or Linux
1. Download zip file from project's GitHub and unzip

2. Navigate to argos **/argos-dev-task-master/argos-task/src/main/resources/static** and (Assuming NodeJS is installed) run **npm install** in the terminal

3. From the **/argos-dev-task-master/argos-task** directory, run the **./gradlew bootRun** command in the terminal. This starts the Jetty server on port 8080

4. In a browser such as Chrome or Firefox, navigate to **http://localhost:8080/app/index.html**

### Windows
1. Download zip file from project's GitHub

2. Navigate to argos **/argos-dev-task-master/argos-task/src/main/resources/static** and (Assuming NodeJS is installed) run **npm install** in the terminal

3. From the **/argos-dev-task-master/argos-task** directory, run the **gradlew bootRun** command on the command line. This starts the Jetty server on port 8080

4. In a browser such as Chrome or Firefox, navigate to **http://localhost:8080/app/index.html**

###Note: 
Loading and processing the JSON data to show the hottest deals may take up to 30 seconds

##Additional Features
- Able to sort by all criteria accept 'image'
- Able to view separate table containing most recently added deals 
- Able to access the URL for the competitor product

##Architecture
I've used a client-server REST architecture for the application. 

This was done with two main technologies: 

1. Spring Framework (Spring HATEOAS, Spring Data JPA, Spring Web MVC) [Server]
2. AngularJS [Client]

My Spring MVC RESTful API consumes JSON data from the HUKD API. The Spring API then processes the JSON
and exposes the transformed HUKD JSON data at the endpoint '/api/products'. This endpoint is accessed
by my AngularJS client application, which consumes the JSON over HTTP.

Example call to '/api/products' provides following response body:
